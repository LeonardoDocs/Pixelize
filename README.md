# Pixelize

**Pixelize** is a Blender add-on for rendering 3D scenes as pixel art. It provides tools for resolution downscaling, color quantization, and pixel-style lighting to help you generate clean, consistent sprites from 3D models.

**Important**: The project is based on the incredible work by **Mezaka**, which you can find explained here: *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwh_TpouPfQ&t=532s* and here: *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W2na8OKC8U*

P.S. I apologize for the comments in Italian — the repository was originally intended as a private project. I’ll gradually work on translating them into English.
A video tutorial on how to use the add-on will be published soon.
